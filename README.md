# Note App
## Description
This project was undertaken as part of a coding bootcamp. For this challenge the front end is completed for us but we need to create a server with the backend routes. The view routes should take us to the seperate page to create notes. The api routes should add to the db.json file and the front end code updates the page with the note. A bonus is adding the delete function.
